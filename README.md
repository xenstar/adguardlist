# Adguard Home

My list contains blocking of some common softwares/websites for tracking, and whitelisting for common services which are blocked in my favourite list. 

You can copy paste this link and directly add in AdguardHome - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xenstar/adguardlist/main/adguardhome

# Please note!

a) I block adobe.com default domain, and only whitelisted some of their service, e.g behance.net, lightroom so it will work smoothly.
b) I block most of hotmail.com, microsoft.com domain, only whitelisted for Microsoft To-Do, Calender, Mail etc
